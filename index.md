<h2 class="about-title">About Me</h2>

Hi there! I am a PhD student at Simon Fraser University, supervised by
<a class="advisor-link" href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~pchilana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Parmit Chilana</a>
and
<a class="advisor-link" href="https://www.nickmvincent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Nick Vincent</a>.
My research focuses on Human–AI interaction and AI literacy.

If you are thinking about applying to graduate schools and are curious about what it is like to work with either of them, I am always happy to chat and share my experience. Please feel free to reach out by email :)
